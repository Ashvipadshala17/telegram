        <h1>Telegram</h1>
        <p>Telegram Messenger, commonly known as Telegram, is a cloud-based, cross-platform, social media and instant messaging (IM) service. 
           It was originally launched for iOS on 14 August 2013 and Android on 20 October 2013. 
           It allows users to exchange messages, share media and files, and hold private and group voice or video calls as well as public livestreams. 
           It is available for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, Linux, and web browsers.
           Telegram offers end-to-end encryption in voice and video calls,[10] and in optional private chats, which Telegram calls Secret Chats.</p>
        <h2><u>History</u></h2>
        <p>Telegram is registered as a company in the British Virgin Islands[9] and as an LLC in Dubai.
          It does not disclose where it rents offices or which legal entities it uses to rent them, citing the need to "shelter the team from unnecessary influence" and 
          protect users from governmental data requests. After Pavel left Russia in 2014, he was said to be moving from country to country with a small group 
          of computer programmers consisting of 15 core members.</p>
